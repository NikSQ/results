Tested variance of gradient.

Network: Continuous 60-60
Dataset: Reduced pen stroke

Method: Networks were trained for 0, 4, 8, 12, 16 epochs. For each network gradient was estimated for l_sampling and g_sampling using 20 forward passes each.

Numbering of numerical_results: First number divided by 2 floored and times 4 gives how long network was trained, first number modulo 2 gives the used method (lr=0, gr=1)
second number refers to the different variables

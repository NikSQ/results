Dataset: reduced pen stroke
Weights: fully continuous
Differences: pfp, pfp with l2 on variance, pfp with uninformative prior, exp3-exp5 had an implementation error, global sampling, global sampling with uninformative prior

Other remarks:

started at low initial variance which then grows
prior variance was set rather large

Conclusions: pfp only works with prior and variance regularization. same phenomenon was not observed for lr (?!)

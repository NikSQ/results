Conducted: 2.12.2018
Dataset: reduced pen stroke
Weights: fully continuous
Differences: pfp, pfp with l2 on variance, pfp with uninformative prior, local sampling, local sampling with l2 on variance, local sampling with uniformative prior, global sampling, global sampling with uninformative prior

Other remarks:
started at low initial variance which then grows
prior variance was set rather large

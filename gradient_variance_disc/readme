Tested variance of gradient.

Network: Discrete weights, continuous bias and activations 60-60
Dataset: Reduced pen stroke

Method: Networks were trained for 0, 20, 40, 60, 80 and 100 epochs and the gradient was then estimated for lr and gr using 20 forward passes.

Numbering of numerical_results: First number divided by 2 floored and times 20 gives how long network was trained, first number modulo 2 gives the used method (lr=0, gr=1)
second number refers to the different variables

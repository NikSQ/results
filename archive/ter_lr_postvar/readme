Conducted: 16.12.2018
Dataset: reduced pen stroke
Weights: ternary weights, continuous bias and activation
Method: local reparametrization
Differences: regularization term on posterior variance [0.0001, 0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 1., 10.]

Other remarks:
KL loss was calculated the wrong way, causing the network to not make much use of -1 weights. however, the kl term was relatively small compared to elogl

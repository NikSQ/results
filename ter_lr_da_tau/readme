Conducted: 1.2019
Dataset: reduced pen stroke
Weights: ternary weights, continuous bias and discrete activation
Method: lr
Differences: tau = [.4, .5, .6, .8, 1.]

Conclusion: for low level of tau, there is often a longer period without much learning progress. gradient variance is probably too high. tau of about .8 works well
